### About Me
I am currently pursuing my studies with a focus on building robust, data-driven applications. My academic journey has been defined by a deep curiosity for how systems work—from the low-level logic of hardware to the high-level abstractions of web frameworks. I thrive in environments that challenge my problem-solving skills and allow me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world projects.

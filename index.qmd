Feel free to explore my site to see my [Final Year Project](fyp-project.qmd), my latest [Data Visualization](data-viz.qmd) work, or my [Reflection](reflection.qmd) on the evolving role of AI in technology.

Hello! I am a dedicated student with a strong foundation in **Computer Science** and **Applied Mathematics**. I am passionate about bridging the gap between complex data analysis and practical software solutions.

I enjoy working on technical projects ranging from **web development** to **data analysis**.

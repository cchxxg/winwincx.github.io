## Visualization of Academic Performance vs. Study Hours

Below is a scatter plot representing the physical characteristics of a sample group, segmented by gender.

### Content of the Visualization
This graph visualizes **quantitative data** across two axes while incorporating a categorical variable. The x-axis represents Height, and the y-axis represents Weight. Each data point is represented by a gender-specific icon—pink for female and blue for male—allowing for an immediate visual comparison of how these physical metrics differ across groups.

### The Story Behind This Task
This visualization was created to explore how physical dimensions correlate within a population and to observe if specific clusters or outliers (like "Philip" or "Joyce") emerge when gender is introduced as a factor. It serves as a practical application of biometric data analysis often found in health sciences or foundational statistics modules.

**Rationale for the Visualization:**
I chose a Scatter Plot with Categorical Encoding because it is the most effective way to identify a correlation between two numerical variables (height and weight) while simultaneously showing group differences.

## Visualization of Academic Performance vs. Study Hours

Below is a scatter plot representing the relationship between weekly study hours and final exam scores for a sample of 50 students in a Statistics module.

### Content of the Visualization
This graph visualizes **quantitative data**. The x-axis represents the independent variable (Study Hours per Week), and the y-axis represents the dependent variable (Exam Scores, ranging from 0-100). Each point on the plot represents an individual student's data.

### The Story Behind This Task
This visualization was created as part of a probability and statistics project to determine if there was a strong positive correlation between time investment and academic results. 

**Rationale for the Visualization:**
I chose a **Scatter Plot** because it is the most effective way to identify the relationship (correlation) between two numerical variables. By adding a trend line, I could clearly show that as study hours increased, exam scores tended to rise, providing a visual representation of the $r$ correlation coefficient we calculated in class.
